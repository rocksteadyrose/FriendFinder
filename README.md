# FriendFinder

Friend Finder (or Fido Finder, in this case!) is a full-stack site application that takes in results from users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users to find the best 'match,' or friend, for them. The app uses a modal to display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
